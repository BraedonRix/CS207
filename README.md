# CS207
A repository for my CS 207 class project

For this project I have replaced the fifth button with the piano key C#4.
A potentiometer was added to control three states.
The first state allows for the buttons and buzzer to act as a piano.
The second state allows for the buttons to act as a music box.
Each button in the music box mode will play a song.
The third state will play every song on a loop.
